                <h2>About Cookies</h2>

                <p>Cookies are the best thing to add to icecream, brownies, and milk! This recipe for cookies is not as sweet as traditional store-bought cookies. I personally think they make for a better topping this way! This recipe can be adjusted if you have a nutt allergy or want to make it sweeter. </p>

                <h3>Recipe:</h3>
                <p>1 1/2 cups of flour </p>
                <p>1/2 tsp baking soda </p>
                <p>1/2 tsp of salt</p>
                <p>Half a cup of butter: soft</p>
                <p>3/4 to 1 cup of sugar</p>
                <p>1/3 cup pf brown sugar firmly packed</p>
                <p> 3/4 tsp of vanilla</p>
                <p> 1 egg beaten</p>
                <p>9 ounces of semisweet chocolate chips </p>
                <p> 1/2 of chopped walmuts if desired</p>
                
                Instructions: 
                Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Combine sifted flour, baking soda, and salt. In a seperate bowl cream butter with sugars until fluffy and light. Beat in vanilla and eggs until smooth. Beat dry ingredients into creamed mixture, a little at a time. Add chocolate chips and walnuts. Stir and fold into batter. Drop dough helpings on cookie sheet, based off which size cookies you would like. I find semi-bigger ones leave the cookie googey on the inside and crispy on the outside. Bake at 350 degress for 10-14 minutes depending on cookie size.
